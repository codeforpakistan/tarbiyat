Review Report by GPGC Internship Office

Regarding: https://tarbiyat.codeforpakistan.org

The overall concept and idea behind this initiative are highly commendable and appear to be very well thought out. However, incorporating the following suggestions into the respective logins will make this initiative more effective and efficient.

Student Login

(john.doe@student.edu | student123)

1. Students should be provided access to submit their daily attendance records through this login.


2. Currently, there is no access to various proformas such as the weekly activity logbook, internship report, etc. A mechanism should be provided so that students can submit these either weekly or after completing a task.


3. Internship duration and time periods should be updated accordingly (Duration: 8–9 weeks; Time period: after the 4th semester till the 8th).


4. Students’ personal details, such as contact numbers, are missing and should be included.


5. It seems that students cannot reapply for the same internship opportunity once they have been rejected. This restriction should be reviewed.


6. Students should be provided space to record their assigned daily tasks and showcase their performance.

Teacher Login

(michael.anderson@utech.edu | teacher123)

1. Students’ contact information is not available, which may be needed for communication or guidance.


2. Teachers should be given access to students’ profiles in order to oversee their attendance and performance.


3. Teachers’ profiles should have access to the required proformas.


4. An evaluation component is missing in the teacher profile and should be included.


5. The “Teacher” login should be renamed as On-Campus Supervisor (as per HEC policy).

Mentor Login

(alex.thompson@techcorp.com | mentor123)

1. This login should be renamed as Industry Supervisor or On-Site Supervisor (as per HEC policy) to avoid confusion, since all proformas already use these terms.


2. Students’ interests are not visible to the mentor while considering candidates. This information should be made available to give industry partners a better idea of the student’s suitability.


3. Proper proformas (e.g., On-Site Supervisor Evaluation Proforma) are missing and should be added.


4. Mentors should have access to students’ activity logbooks and daily attendance so that feedback can be maintained in one place. This will also allow other stakeholders to verify students’ inputs easily.


5. A marking and evaluation component is missing in this login and should be incorporated.

Official Login

(john.official@gov.edu | official123)

1. Contact numbers for students, teachers, and mentors (on-site supervisors) are not available and should be included.


2. This login should serve as the main administrative login for each college.


3. Officials should have access to all other logins (students, teachers, mentors) in order to effectively monitor progress.


4. It should also provide access to all proformas and students’ progress reports.


5. While the start date of the internship is mentioned, the closing date is missing. Both should be included to clearly define the duration.
